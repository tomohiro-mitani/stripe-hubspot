# Simple Monthly Billing

This simple monthly billing demo was originally built for the Gogo Inflight Wifi EBC presentation, but we've since repurposed it to just be a more generic billing demo to show creating a monthly, fixed priced subscription with Stripe. It follows relatively closely the ["Simple monthly billing" example in our docs](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/examples#simple-monthly-billing).

**You can try the app live at [https://simple-monthly-billing.stripedemos.com/](https://simple-monthly-billing.stripedemos.com/).**

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
|     |Features
:---: | :---
üì¶|**Products and Prices.** Furni uses the Stripe [Products and Prices](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/prices-guide) APIs.
‚ö°Ô∏è|**Customers.** Furni allows customers to create accounts which creates new [Customers](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/customer) in Stripe to save purchase history.
üí≥|**Elements** This demo uses pre-built Stripe components customized to fit the app design, including the [Stripe Elements](https://stripe.com/docs/elements) which provides real-time validation, formatting, and localization.

## Running locally

If you want to run this demo locally against a different Stripe account, follow the instructions below:

### Requirements

* You'll need a Stripe account. [Sign up for free](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register) before running the application.
* Ruby 2.6.3

### Getting Started

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```
$ git clone https://git.corp.stripe.com/stripe-internal/solutions-demos
$ cd simple-monthly-billing
$ bundle
```

Copy the .env.template file. You'll need to fill out the Publishable and Secret key details from your [Stripe account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/apikeys)

```
$ cp .env.template .env
```

Run the app!
```
$ bundle exec ruby app.rb
```

Go to [http://localhost:4567](http://localhost:4567) in your browser to start using the demo.

## Resetting Data
If you'd like to wipe the slate clean and start with a fresh environment, you can [wipe all test data](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/data) from your Stripe account. This demo runs purely on top of the Stripe API with no local database so wiping the Stripe account resets the entire application.
